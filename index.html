						The exact definition of what agile or extreme programming are isn’t important if you’re unfamiliar with the terms.
						The most important parts to me when building software is doing so by constantly iterating on ideas, working in tiny, incremental steps, and working in a highly collaborative environment.

						This talk is about how I used the tools that I and so many of us use to build effective software to build a community garden.

						That first season, I didn’t know where to begin. I had a general plan to have a nice garden but no concrete goals. I would bite off too much and leave projects unfinished. I was feeling unaccomplaished by not achieving small wins.

						I did learn some lessons that first season. I realized how valuable and how much more enjoyable it was to work with my fellow gardeners.
