						In April 2016, I moved to the Fenway neighborhood in Boston.
						<br>
						If there are some new yorkers in here shuddering at the word ‘Fenway’ or ‘Boston’, don’t worry, I actually grew up in Queens, go Mets.
						<br>
						I moved to this neighborhood, and somehow failed to realize in six years of living in Boston that there is a huge garden community in this park called the Fens.
						<br>
						The Fenway Victory Gardens span about 7 acres of consist of over 500 garden plots that have been in use since 1942.
						<br>
						They were originally WW2 victory gardens to produce local food in a time of war rations. After the war, the Fenway Garden Society was formed, and has since been a volunteer run non-profit.
						<br>
						Upon moving to the neighborhood, I immediately joined the wait list to get a plot.
						<br>
						For as long as I can remember I’ve always wanted a garden and thought urban gardens were the coolest thing. I was really excited, and I was lucky and got one right away. I’ve heard of people waiting for years on this list. It...

						That first season, I didn’t know where to begin. I had a general idea to have this nice garden but no concrete vision or goals - it was like I didn’t have any product direction.
						<br>
						I would think of something Big to do, lose focus, and leave projects unfinished. I wasn’t delivering any value to the user (which was me). My garden wasn’t improving at a rate that I felt good about, and I was feeling unaccomplaished by not finishing projects and achieving small wins.
						<br>
						I was clearly lacking in the project management department. For example, at one point I decided that I wanted an herb garden and a brick lined path. I’d go back and forth between the two, and I didn’t prioritize tasks between those projects. I ended up with a half finished path and a weedy herb garden.

						I did learn some valuable lessons that first season, though.
						...Like mulching (I didn’t know the magic of mulch?? It would have helped manage some of the weed growth)
						<br>
						THE most valuable, though, was collaborating with my fellow gardeners.
						I enjoyed meeting people in my row, and loved getting to know a diverse group of people, spanning many different ages, ethnicities, and occupations.
						<br>
						As gardeners, we have mandated volunteer hours to work on the garden as a whole, things like litter clean up, weeding public spaces, and tending our compost piles. I would meet other folks and learn a lot of useful, random tidbits - like how someone used red onions to repel aphids from tomatoes, or the importance of well-drained soil for certain plants.

						One example of this is was starting my own seedlings.
						Seedlings, if you don’t know, are seeds once they’ve sprouted. They are typically grown inside, like in a greenhouse, with the intention to plant them outside.

						I bought a dozen or so packets of seeds and peat pods. I was sure the sunny window ledges in my apartment would be a great home for growing seeds. My new cat at the time, Boston,

						One task became 14 smaller ones! This was very powerful. It felt good and satisfying to check off individual tasks. It made approaching building this feature of my garden less intimidating, and easiser to plan. It was easier to stop work for the day and know where to pick up the next. It was easisert delegate and parallel process work with my partner.

						I mentioned that the most valuable lesson I had learned last summer was the power in my community.
						I talked to more gardeners in my garden society and got to know more of my neighbors. I learned someone in my row is a rose expert, and spent twenty years volunteering in the rose garden across the park.
						I took advantage of events for the community, like a seed swap we had.
						I also talked about my garden a lot. I talked about the sucesses AND failures I was having.
						I talked about gardening to my coworkers and learned we have quite the group of gardeners at work. I’m talking about it now.

						One hot tip I learned from a coworker was to use fox urine to repel rabbits. The fens has a huge rabbit problem. It’s ironic because I’ve heard it’s an endangered species somewhere so we can’t do much about them. But, one of my coworkers was also facing a rabbit problem and told me how you can go to the garden store and buy a bottle of fox urine! It saved my portugese kale.

						Through iterating on ideas and plans, working incrementally, and collaborating with my community, things we talk about in tech all the time, building my garden was much more fun and productive process.
						We spend so much time as people who build software refining and optimizing our processes. They don’t always translate outside of software project management, but I really believe it’s worth exploring how to apply some of these great ideas in other areas. At the heart of this, we want to satisfy us, our users.
