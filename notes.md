## slide 1
Hi everyone! My name is Amanda Muñoz and I’m a software engineer and consultant at Pivotal Labs here in Cambridge.
At Pivotal, my day to day is building on projects using our take agile and extreme programming methodologies.

## slide 2
The exact definition of what agile or extreme programming are isn’t important if you’re unfamiliar with the terms.
The most important parts to me when building software is doing so by constantly iterating on ideas, working in tiny, incremental steps, and working in a highly collaborative environment.
Since working in an environment that values these practices, I’ve found myself thinking in this agile way in and outside of work and applying it to non-software projects.
